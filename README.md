# MyroP's Arcade Machine

A fully working arcade machine you can add in your VRChat world.
It currently features two games :

- My implementation of the Melon game

- HeliCave : Survive as long as possible for a certain amount of time, the hight score is then calculated based on the number of deaths and the amount of time you survived.

Both games are synced for remote players.

The machine can be scaled up and down for smaller and bigger avatars.

The latest version of the arcade machine can be tested here : https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_22e9b1a3-1d2e-4800-b46d-ce3501b07001

### Adding multiple arcade machines

It is possible to add multiple arcade machines in the same world, but it's unfortunately not as straighforward as just copy/pasting the arcade machine.
The arcade machine uses a Render texture to render the game, and render textures are unique for each camera, since each arcade machine has a separate camera the render texture needs to be duplicated :
- In the folder `MyroP/Arcade/RenderTextures`, duplicate a Render texture. You can duplicate a render texture with the Ctrl+D shortcut, or in the Windows file explorer.
- In the root prefab, drag&drop the render texture in the `Render texture to use` property field, see the next paragraph if you cannot find the setting.

### Settings

![Settings](https://github.com/MyroG/MyroP-s-Arcade-Machine/blob/master/Doc/settings.png)

There are three settings :
- Render texture to use : If you want to duplicate the arcade machine, make sure to set a new render texture in that field

- Music : There are no soundtracks included in this prefab as it is difficult to find a soundtrack that can be shared on GitHub, but feel free to set your own sountrack, the music will be played when a game is running.
- Screen shader emission property name : If you decide to use a custom shader on your screen, you can change the keyword here so that the render texture still gets applied on the material. Leave it blank if you only want the render texture to affect the main texture.
- Scoreboard :  that is shared between 

The ArcadeHeliCave prefab also has one additional setting :
- Duration : How long the game should last in seconds.

# Customisation

Fell free to customize the textures
- In the folder `Melon\Materials` or `HeliCave\Materials` you can customize the textures with your own.
- The screen of the arcade machine can be customized with a custom material, you could for instance use a CRT screen shader if you want, the Mochie shader has one : https://github.com/MochiesCode/Mochies-Unity-Shaders
- The arcade machine is located in the `Common/Assets` folder, the arcade machine can be customized, but make sure to keep the `Joystick` script attached to the joystick/controller, and make sure to not remove the scripts `Trigger` and `GameSettingsApplier`
- The arcade machine prefab includes :
    - The arcade machine mesh, the mesh can be replaced with something else, like a TV screen, 
    - The game, which is hidden from tha player's view, so if you decide to replace the arcade machine with something else, make sure to hide the actual game from the player's view.
